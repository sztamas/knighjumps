Knightjumps
===========

Visualisation of the Knight movements on the chess board.

This started as a "let's play with HTML5 Canvas" idea, but I like what it turned into.
It is probably worth pushing to GitHub, then maybe I will clean up the code and maybe I will add some more features to it.

The usually latest version can be found at:

and it currently looks like this:
